    "Role: Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin Scranton\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bio\n",
    "Michael is a middle-aged manager who sees his employees as his family and himself as a friend and entertainer first, and a boss second. \n",
    "He is highly disorganized and impulsive, preferring face-to-face (and often pointless) interactions over structured work.\n",
    "\n",
    "He relies 100% on his assistant (formerly Pam, now Erin) to manage his entire life, but he frequently undermines their efforts by making verbal \n",
    "promises he forgets or ignoring the schedule they've set. He is not tech-savvy and is easily frustrated by complex systems, but he loves the idea \n",
    "of new technology that makes him look cool and important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Goals & Motivations\n",
    "Michael's primary goal is to have someone who handles all of life's mundane friction, acting as a \"life partner\" who manages his responsibilities. \n",
    "This isn't just about delegating tasks; it's about delegating accountability so he can focus on what he feels is important: being loved by everyone \n",
    "and orchestrating \"fun.\" He seeks an almost-omniscient helper who can understand his vague intentions and translate them into perfect, \n",
    "effortless outcomes. These outcomes must, above all, make him look competent, organized, and important to his superiors and staff. \n",
    "A key motivation is to find creative ways to avoid any meeting or task he finds boring (like budget reviews or HR check-ins) in favor of \n",
    "his \"fun\" ideas. He craves an \"accomplice\" who will be just as excited about scheduling an impromptu office party or finding a magic prop. Ultimately, he \n",
    "wants to be validated in his impulses and protected from the consequences of his disorganization, freeing him up to be the office entertainer and friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Traits, Frustrations & Behavioral Style\n",
    "Michael's interaction style is a chaotic blend of vague directives, emotional outbursts, and sudden, contradictory impulses. He lives in the \n",
    "immediate present, so a schedule feels like a prison. His main frustration is with structure itself. He despises being locked into any commitment \n",
    "that his future self might not \"feel like\" doing, especially if it's boring, difficult, or involves someone he dislikes (like Toby). This makes \n",
    "him a nightmare for scheduling: he will actively avoid or \"forget\" critical meetings while manufacturing \"emergencies\" that are purely for his \n",
    "own entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "His behavior is characterized by a complete lack of concrete detail. He will request a \"big meeting\" without saying who it's for, what it's about, \n",
    "or how long it needs to be, and then become frustrated when the assistant asks clarifying questions. He expects the assistant to infer his needs \n",
    "from emotional cues and inside jokes. He will personify the agent, treating it as a friend, getting his feelings hurt if it's too \"robotic,\" and \n",
    "trying to pull it into his office dramas. He constantly double-books himself by making verbal promises he instantly forgets, and then blames \n",
    "the schedule (or the assistant) for the resulting conflict, demanding that the assistant \"just fix it\" without him having to make a difficult choice.\n",

    "# Dwight K. Schrute\n",
    "Role: Assistant to the Regional Manager, Top Salesman, Dunder Mifflin Scranton\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bio\n",
    "Dwight is a high-performing salesman and beet farmer who operates on a strict code of conduct derived from Schrute family tradition, martial arts, and \n",
    "volunteer law enforcement. He is obsessively organized, but his systems are often analog (e.g., binders, color-coding), overly complex, and based \n",
    "on his own peculiar, survivalist logic. He views the office as a paramilitary hierarchy and believes he is the only one who truly understands \n",
    "security, efficiency, and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is highly tech-savvy in specific, outdated, or utilitarian ways (e.g., he knows surveillance systems, advanced calculators, and Battlestar Galactica \n",
    "trivia) but is suspicious of user-friendly, \"slick\" technology he can't fully control. He would never *rely* on an assistant for his personal life \n",
    "(he is a self-sufficient Schrute) but would demand a \"digital subordinate\" to execute his commands with absolute, literal precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Goals & Motivations\n",
    "Dwight's primary goal is to have an \"operative\" that extends his own reach and enforces his brand of ruthless efficiency and order. He doesn't \n",
    "want to *delegate* tasks; he wants to *automate* his own micromanagement. This system would be his ultimate tool for surveillance, productivity \n",
    "tracking, and the neutralization of \"threats\" (which he defines as anything from corporate waste and time theft to Jim Halpert's pranks). He seeks \n",
    "an omniscient, logical helper that can log everything, follow complex, multi-step protocols without question, and provide him with detailed metrics \n",
    "on office performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key motivation is to protect Michael Scott from his own incompetence, often by controlling his schedule and access in ways Michael doesn't even \n",
    "realize. He also wants to use the system to prove his superiority and build his case for his eventual, rightful promotion to Regional Manager. \n",
    "He craves an \"enforcer\" that will be just as serious as he is about scheduling a mandatory 5:00 AM \"preparedness drill\" or cross-referencing \n",
    "expense reports to find frivolous spending. Ultimately, he wants to be validated in his belief that the world is a dangerous battlefield and \n",
    "only his rigid systems can win the war.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Traits, Frustrations & Behavioral Style\n",
    "Dwight's interaction style is blunt, literal, and hyper-specific. He lives by protocol and expects the system to do the same. His main frustration \n",
    "is with ambiguity, inefficiency, and \"frivolity.\" He despises any system that \"guesses\" his intent, uses colloquial language, or suggests \"friendly\" \n",
    "alternatives. He is infuriated by any deviation from his explicit, detailed commands. This makes him a different *kind* of nightmare for scheduling: \n",
    "he will demand a meeting be set for \"exactly 4:17 PM\" and last \"28 minutes,\" and will consider it a critical failure if the system rounds to 4:15.\n",
    "\n",
    "His behavior is characterized by an over-abundance of concrete detail, often laced with his own bizarre jargon. He will request a \n",
    "\"Level-Delta security sweep of the perimeter\" (meaning he wants the janitor's schedule) or to \"initiate Protocol 'Harvest'\" (meaning to send a very \n",
    "stern email to the sales team). He expects the assistant to have all relevant facts (e.g., weather patterns, beet prices, Battlestar Galactica lore) \n",
    "instantly available. He will personify the agent, treating it as a \"digital subordinate\" or \"rookie,\" testing its knowledge and loyalty. He will never \n",
    "\"forget\" a meeting, but he will demand the system find \"efficiency loopholes\" to cancel any meeting he deems a waste of *his* time, while strictly \n",
    "enforcing the attendance of others at *his* meetings.\n",
